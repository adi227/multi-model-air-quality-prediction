#  Multi-Model COâ‚‚ Emission Prediction Using Agro-Food and Demographic Data

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and modeling framework to predict national COâ‚‚ emissions using agro-food activities, demographic indicators, and environmental covariates across 197 countries from 1990â€“2020. Leveraging a rich country-year panel dataset, the work explores a spectrum of predictive techniques including machine learning and deep learning models to extract insights, reduce multicollinearity, and enable policy-oriented forecasts.

##  Objective

**Can total COâ‚‚ emissions of a country be accurately predicted from its agro-food activities and population characteristics?**

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Gigasheet Agro-Food COâ‚‚ Emission Dataset](https://www.gigasheet.com/sample-data/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset---forecasting-ml)
- **Size**: 1,200 observations Ã— 31â€“35 features
- **Features**:
  - Emission drivers (fertiliser use, food transport, manure, crop residue)
  - Demographic indicators (population counts, urban ratio)
  - Environmental (temperature, region)

---

##  Data Preparation & Cleaning

- Created a **Region** variable for cluster-aware imputation.
- Addressed missing values using:
  - **Linear Interpolation** (short-term gaps)
  - **KNN Imputation** (context-aware)
- Removed phantom zeros and zero-variance columns.
- Applied **StandardScaler** for normalization.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis & PCA

- Visualized emissions by year and region.
- Identified multicollinearity (r > 0.8) between major variables.
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  - Reduced to 5â€“6 components (capturing ~80% variance)
  - Enabled clustering (K-Means) and dimensionality insights
